IRIDA Import Tool for Galaxy
============================

This is a [Galaxy][galaxy] tool that imports sequence data from [IRIDA][irida] to Galaxy. Data is imported as a series of links (instead of directly copying the files from IRIDA to Galaxy).
This requires that the IRIDA and Galaxy instance both share the same filesystem.

# 1. Usage

This tool lets you import data from IRIDA into Galaxy (via a Galaxy Dataset Library, which links to the files instead of making copies).

Detailed instructions are available in the [IRIDA Documentation][irida-docs]. But, for a quick overview, please see below:

## 1.1. Click **Get Data > IRIDA**.

In Galaxy, please find the **IRIDA** tool, likely under the **Get Data** section in the Tool Panel.

![galaxy-import-tool.png][]

Clicking this tool will redirect you to IRIDA.

## 1.2. Select IRIDA samples and add to cart

![irida-select-samples.png][]

## 1.3. From cart, export to Galaxy

From the cart, you can export the selected samples to Galaxy.

![irida-galaxy-export.png][]

## 1.4. Data is now in Galaxy

You should be redirected to Galaxy, where the export tool will run and load up the data (fastq files) within your Galaxy History.

![galaxy-history-datasets.png][]

# 2. Install Instructions

This is a [DataSource][data-source] tool in Galaxy, which is a special type of tool used to integrate data from external sites into a local Galaxy instance. In the case of IRIDA, this requires configuration of connection details directly in the tool so that it can contact the correct IRIDA server with the appropriate API details. This means that installation requires a bit more manual steps then regular Galaxy tools to fill in these connection details.

## 2.1. Installing code

There are overall two different methods to install this tool, through a Galaxy [ToolShed][galaxy-toolshed] or directly from GitHub (you only have to choose one of these options).

### 2.1.1. Install from Galaxy ToolShed

The easiest way to install this tool is via a Galaxy ToolShed. The specific ToolShed this tool is located within is the [IRIDA ToolShed][irida-toolshed].
You will want to install the tool located at <http://irida.corefacility.ca/galaxy-shed/view/irida/irida_galaxy_importer/d82238b091f2>.

#### 2.1.1.1. Adding the IRIDA ToolShed

If your Galaxy instance is not configured to make use of the IRIDA ToolShed you will have to modifiy it.

Please find the `tool_sheds_conf.xml` file in the [galaxy/config/][galaxy-conf] directory.
If you do not have this file, you can make a copy from the sample file provided by Galaxy `cp tool_sheds_conf.xml.sample tool_sheds_conf.xml`.

Add the following line to this file:

```xml
<tool_shed name="IRIDA Toolshed" url="https://irida.corefacility.ca/galaxy-shed/"/>
```

Now, restart Galaxy. You should see the IRIDA ToolShed available from **Admin** then **Install new tools**.

![irida-toolshed.png][]

#### 2.1.1.2. Install IRIDA Importer tool from ToolShed

From within the IRIDA ToolShed, find the [irida_galaxy_importer][irida-importer-irida-toolshed] tool and install to Galaxy.

Once installed, you should see it show up in your list of installed tools (**Admin > Mange tools**).

![irida-galaxy-importer-tool.png][]

#### 2.1.1.3. (Optional) Fix dependency issues

If the tool reports an error like **missing tool dependencies**, you can click on the tool for more details. For example:

![irida-tool-dependency-error.png][]

Here, it looks like the Python virtual environment did not load properly. So, let's fix this.

First, login to the machine running Galaxy and navigate to the directory shown in the error
(here it's `/export/tool_deps/irida-galaxy-importer/1.3.0/irida/irida_galaxy_importer/d82238b091f2/`).

```
cd /export/tool_deps/irida-galaxy-importer/1.3.0/irida/irida_galaxy_importer/d82238b091f2/
```

Now, we'll just delete the `venv` directory and re-create it.

```bash
rm -rf venv

virtualenv venv
```

Now, let's activate the virtual environment and re-install the dependencies.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If everything worked, great. We can move on to configuring the tool and Galaxy.

### 2.1.2. Install from GitHub

If, instead, you wish to install the tool via GitHub (e.g., to use the latest code), please follow the instructions below.

*Note: If you've already installed the tool from the ToolShed, you can skip this step.*

#### 2.1.2.1. Clone to Galaxy tools/ directory

The Galaxy [tools/][galaxy-tools] directory contains tools that come with the Galaxy code. You can add your own to this directory and configure Galaxy to load them up. We will do this for the **IRIDA Import Tool**.

```bash
cd galaxy/tools/

git clone -b master https://github.com/phac-nml/irida-galaxy-importer.git irida_import
cd irida_import

# Optional. Checkout specific release from https://github.com/phac-nml/irida-galaxy-importer/releases
#git checkout [LATEST_RELEASE]
```

#### 2.1.2.2. Install dependencies

This tool requires Python 3 and a number of Python libraries. You must make sure these are installed and available on all machines this tool will be run with (e.g., if you are submitting to a cluster, these must be available on all cluster nodes).

If you are only running Galaxy on a single machine, please install **Python 3** and use `pip3` to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install bioblend requests-oauthlib
```

You may need to also install the Python and YAML development libraries. On Ubuntu, you can install them with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libyaml-dev
```

#### 2.1.2.3. Configure Galaxy to see tool

In order to configure Galaxy to see the tool, please find the `galaxy/config/tool_conf.xml` file which is located in the [galaxy/config][galaxy-conf] directory.
If the `galaxy/config/tool_conf.xml` you can copy the sample from this same `config/` directory. An example of this file can also be found in the [Galaxy code][tool-conf-sample].

Once you've found the file, please add the following line:

```xml
<tool file="irida_import/irida_import.xml" />
```

You likely want to add this to the **Get Data** section, so your modification will likely look like:

```xml
<toolbox monitor="true">
  <section id="getext" name="Get Data">
    <!-- Add below line to your file -->
    <tool file="irida_import/irida_import.xml" />
```

### 2.1.3. Set appropriate configuration options in Galaxy

No matter which way you install the code (ToolShed or GitHub), you will have to set some configuration options in Galaxy to get this tool to work.

This tool works by making links to the IRIDA data files (instead of directly copying them). In order to do this, you will
have to enable the following options in the Galaxy `galaxy/config/galaxy.yml` file. An example of this file can be found on the [Galaxy GitHub][galaxy-config-sample] page.

Please enable the following:

```yaml
allow_path_paste: True
```

## 2.2. Tool Connection Configuration

Once the tool is installed in Galaxy, we can move on to configuring the connection details for the tool with both IRIDA and Galaxy.

### 2.2.1. Create a Galaxy admin account/api key

The tool makes use of linking to files via a Galaxy Dataset Library. This requires you to configure an API key in Galaxy linked to an administrator account to be used by the tool.
You will first have to setup a [Galaxy Admin User][galaxy-admin-user] to be used by this tool (it can be the same account as your normal Galaxy Admin user if you wish).

You will also have to create an API key for this user by going to **User > Preferences > Manage API key**.

![galaxy-api-key.png][]

In this case, the Galaxy API key is:

* **Galaxy API Key**: `d9c54f0b38b75dd6513035e4dd786a0b`

#### 2.2.1.1. Make sure permissions are correct

You will also have to make sure that the **access** permissions are blank in **User > Preferences > Set dataset permissions for new histories**, otherwise files may not import correctly.

![galaxy-dataset-permissions.png][]

### 2.2.2. Create an IRIDA client id/key

On the IRIDA end, you will have to setup an IRIDA client id and key so that the **IRIDA Import Tool** can communicate with IRIDA.

To do this, please follow the [Creating a New System Client][irida-new-client] instructions in the IRIDA documentation.
You will want to create a client with **Grant Types** set to `authorization_code` and with **Read** access (you do not need **write** access).

Please make sure to remember the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. In this case they would be:

![irida-client.png][]

* **Client ID**: `galaxy`
* **Client Secret**: `qlB82t7Ct917127lL7oQ82bd9o2iAP8bT0rJohpz7s`

### 2.2.3. Configure tool

*WARNING: The tool is currently set to ALLOW unsecured connections to IRIDA. This option MUST be disabled if the tool
 will be used over the internet. Set `os.environ['OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT']` to `0` in `irida_import.py` to disable it, or delete that line.*

Once we have all the connection information for both IRIDA and Galaxy, we can move onto configuring the tool to connect to IRIDA and Galaxy.

You will first want to find the directory containing the [config.ini.sample][config-sample] file. If installed via GitHub, see section [2.1.2.1][section-2.1.2.1] to find this directory.
If installed via the ToolShed, you will have to find the Galaxy `shed_tools/` directory and navigate to a directory named something like `shed_tools/irida.corefacility.ca/galaxy-shed/repos/irida/irida_galaxy_importer/d82238b091f2/irida_galaxy_importer/`.
The `shed_tools/` directory is often one directory up from the main Galaxy installation (e.g., `galaxy/../shed_tools/`). But, this may change depending on your instllation.

Once you have found the directory containing the `config.ini.sample` file, please copy this file to `config.ini`:

```bash
cp config.ini.sample config.ini
```

You will next want to make the appropriate changes with your connection information. For example:

```
[Galaxy]

### MODIFY THESE ###
admin_key: d9c54f0b38b75dd6513035e4dd786a0b
galaxy_url: http://localhost:48888
####################

illumina_path: /illumina_reads
reference_path: /references
xml_file: irida_import.xml
max_waits: 120
max_client_http_attempts: 10
client_http_retry_delay: 30

[IRIDA]

### MODIFY THESE ###
client_secret: qlB82t7Ct917127lL7oQ82bd9o2iAP8bT0rJohpz7s
client_id: galaxy
irida_url: http://localhost:8080
####################

initial_endpoint_suffix: /projects
token_endpoint_suffix: /api/oauth/token
```

You will want to modify the URL values and connection information (for both IRIDA and Galaxy).
That is, for Galaxy, modify `admin_key`, and `galaxy_url`. For IRIDA modify `irida_url`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`.

It is also possible to configure the folders in which sample files and reference data are stored, and the endpoints at which the tool
expects to access IRIDA resources (but the defaults are fine).

### 2.2.4. Generate tool XML file

Once you've set the appropriate connection details in the `config.ini` file, please run:

```bash
python3 -m irida_import.irida_import --config
```

This should print out:

```
Successfully configured the XML file!
```

And you should now see a `irida_import.xml` file in the directory which contains the proper details to connect between your IRIDA and Galaxy instances.

*Note: Depending on how you've installed the tool, to run this command you may also have to either install additional Python dependencies(e.g., like in section [2.1.2.2][section-2.1.2.2])
or load up the appropriate virtual environment with the dependencies (like in section [2.1.1.3][section-2.1.1.3]).

## 2.3. Restart Galaxy

Once you've made the above changes, please restart Galaxy. The **IRIDA Import Tool** should now appear in your Galaxy tool panel.

![galaxy-import-tool.png][]

Congratulations! You should now be able to use the tool to transfer data from the configured IRIDA to Galaxy.

# 3. Development and Testing

If you wish to make additions to the code, the below instructions can be used to test out your additions in our test suite.

*Note: It is not necessary to install the tool in Galaxy to run the below tests. These will automatically configure a Galaxy and IRIDA instance with the tool to test it out.*

## 3.1. Installing test dependencies

The script `run-tests.sh` can be used to run the tests. This should check for some of the dependencies and let you know which is missing. However, you will have to have the following dependencies installed:

* Java 11
* Maven
* MySQL/MariaDB (Server and Client)
* PostgreSQL (Server and Client)
* Git
* Chrome (or Chromium) and Chromedriver
* Xvfb

On Ubuntu, you can install these with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk maven mariadb-client mariadb-server postgresql git chromium-chromedriver xvfb
```

MySQL must be configured to grant all privileges to the user `test` with password `test` for the databases `irida_test`. MySQL must also be configured to disable `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` mode.

```bash
echo "grant all privileges on irida_test.* to 'test'@'localhost' identified by 'test';" | mysql -u root -p

mysql -u root -e "SET GLOBAL sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));"
```

## 3.2. Running tests

To run all the test, you can run:

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

If you just want to run the unit tests (much quicker) you can do:

```bash
source .ci/install_deps.sh
cd irida_import
pytest tests/unit/*.py
```
